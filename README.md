# SIC Virtual Machine

## Overview
The SIC Virtual Machine (SIC-VM) is an educational software designed to help students understand the fundamentals of computer architecture and programming. Based on the Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC) architecture, the SIC-VM simulates the behavior of a basic machine with an emphasis on low-level programming, memory management, and instruction execution. Students can write and execute SIC programs, visualize memory and registers, and step through their code to gain a deeper understanding of how computers execute instructions.

In addition to the core SIC architecture, the SIC-VM is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing other users to add additional computer architectures as separate modules. This feature makes the software versatile, as it can evolve with new architectures while maintaining compatibility with the core system.

## Key Features
SIC Architecture Simulation: Simulates the SIC machine with basic instructions, registers, and memory.
Modular Architecture: A plugin-based system allows the easy addition of new architectures by users, making the software adaptable to future needs.
Step-by-Step Execution: Provides the ability to step through instructions to understand their impact on the machine’s state.
Memory & Register Visualization: Real-time visualization of the machine’s memory and registers to assist with debugging and understanding the internal workings of the machine.
* Instruction Set: Implements key SIC instructions (e.g., LDA, STA, ADD, SUB) and their effects on registers and memory.
* Extensibility: Offers a framework for extending the system with custom architectures, supporting both educational and research use cases.
* Documentation & Tutorials: Comprehensive tutorials to guide students through SIC programming and usage of the virtual machine. Clear documentation on how to add new architectures to the system.

## Learning Objectives
This project aims to provide students with:

An understanding of the SIC architecture, including its registers, memory management, and instruction set.
The ability to write, compile, and debug SIC programs, gaining insight into low-level programming and machine language.
A foundation in computer architecture concepts such as the instruction cycle, memory addressing, and input/output operations.
Exposure to the challenges and advantages of modular design in software development through the ability to add new architectures.
Modularity & Extensibility
The virtual machine is designed with modularity in mind, allowing others to add new computer architectures as plugins. Each architecture is implemented as a separate module, which can define its own instruction set, memory model, and registers. Users can contribute their own architectures or adapt the system to different educational or research needs. This feature ensures that the software remains scalable and adaptable for future developments.

## Technologies Used
* Programming Languages: Python, C++, or Java (based on the intended platform)
* Libraries: Standard libraries for GUI (e.g., Tkinter, Qt), memory management, and visualization.
* Version Control: GitHub for code versioning, documentation, and collaboration.
* Documentation Tools: Markdown or Sphinx for generating readable and structured documentation.
Project Goals
Develop a fully functional SIC virtual machine that can be used for educational purposes.
Enable modular architecture support so users can add new architectures without modifying the core system.
Provide a user-friendly interface that allows students to learn and experiment with the SIC architecture.
Create an extensive set of tutorials and examples to guide users in understanding how to use the system effectively.
